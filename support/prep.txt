 ok, all should be in txt format, generate prompt.txt which tells why and what we are trying to build, the how will be split in 2 files, prompt.txt will outline the flow and operations that will get triggered and hints.txt outlines all the little coding snippets

this is the flow I'm thinking, improvise base don our conversation as well:
user:
forks the repo or just the generate.sh file
does some oc commands to override any exports in config.env
runs generate.sh which'll output a single yaml file with multiple documents, each document starts with a "#, <a single line description>, a new line then the content" (easy to do grep '^#,' resources.yaml later on)
creates the yaml - it'll have namespace, rbac, configmap, scc, sts-shared or sts-noshare or both, corresponding service, ds-init

runtime:
sts-shared: creates luns and exports them, runs in a central zone and reachable via svc
sts-noshare: creates luns and exports them, runs 1 per unique zone and reachable via svc
ds-init: mounts the scsci disk, ie, X global, Y/zone for a toal of X+(Y*zone) disks

all with proper setup and cleanup code

env:
global: count (2), size (10Gi), zone
zonal: count (1), size (10Gi)
iqnprefix, ns, sc, image, node-label-filter (for ds)

project is sanim, containerfile with registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:43 as base,
all long options for iscsi, an faq section about why sts, dumb ds,  host <-> container flow.
